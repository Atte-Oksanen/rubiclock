            <p>
                RubiClock is a timer for speed cubing, solving the Rubik's cube and other twisty puzzles as fast as
                possible. It contains the most important features for practising and helps you bring your skills to the
                next level.

            <p>
                Before solving, the cube must of course be scrambled. This can be done as so called hand scramble, which
                means the cube is twisted with random moves for some amount of time. This is easy, but has some
                donwsizes. For example, you can't retry the same scramble, the state the cube is before the solve. In
                competitions, a program is used that generates a random scramble.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scramble is written in Rubic's cube notation. You can read more about notation in
                <a href="https://jperm.net/3x3/moves">here</a>. In RubiClock, there is also a visualization of the
                generated scramble, that
                allows you to check the you followed the notation correctly.

            <p>
                When the cube is scrambled you can start the timer by either clicking one of the hand symbols or
                pressing the space bar. In competitions, competitors have 15 seconds to inspect the cube, planning ahead
                the first phase or phases of the solve, and orient the cube to table in desired way. In RubiClock, you
                can change the lenght of inspection time in the setting menu. If you want to disable it alltogether, you
                can set it to 0 seconds.

            <p>
                In competitions, the judge signals the competitor when 8 seconds and 12 seconds of inspection time has
                passed. To enable this in RubiClock, go to the settings menu. To lear more about competition rules, read
                the World Cube Association regulations <a
                    href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/">here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The RubiClock timer starts automatically after the inspection time, but you can start it when you want
                by clicking one of the hand symbols or pressing the space button. The timer starts running and when the
                solve is ready, you can stop it the same way as starting.

                The completed solves with time and scramble appear at the bottom. You can share your latest solve with
                others on the leaderboard. On the bottom left side you can view your session statistics: average, median
                and average of last. You can download your times from "Download session times" button.
