            <p>
                RubiClock is a timer for speed cubing, solving the Rubik's cube and other twisty puzzles as fast as
                possible. It contains the most important features for practising and helps you bring your skills to the
                next level.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before solving, the cube must of course be scrambled. This can be done as a so called hand scramble, which
                means the cube is twisted with random moves for some amount of time. This is easy, but has some
                donwsides to it. For example, you can't retry the same scramble, as there is no record of the conducted moves. In
                competitions, a program is used that generates a random scramble.
                <br>
                <br>
                The scramble is written in Rubic's cube notation. You can read more about notation at 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://jperm.net/3x3/moves">Rubik's Cube Move Notation</a>. In RubiClock, there is also a visualization of the
                scrambled cube, that allows you to check that you followed the notation correctly.
            </p>

            <h3 id="Starting">Starting the timer</h3>
            <p>
                When the cube is scrambled, you can start the timer by either clicking one of the hand symbols or
                pressing the space bar on the keyboard.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> For the mouse input, the timer starts at the beginning of the click, 
                but with the keyboard input, the timer starts when the key is let go.
                <br>
                <br>
                In competitions, competitors have 15 seconds to inspect the cube, planning ahead
                the first phase or phases of the solve, and orient the cube to table in desired way. In RubiClock, you
                can change the lenght of <em><strong>inspection time</strong></em> in the settings menu. If you want to disable it alltogether, you
                can set it to 0 seconds.
            </p>

                In competitions, the judge signals the competitor when 8 seconds and 12 seconds of inspection time has
                passed. To enable this in RubiClock, go to the settings menu and enable <em><strong>timer sound</strong></em>. 
                To learn more about competition rules, head to the the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/">World Cube Association regulations</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                The RubiClock timer starts automatically after the inspection time, but you can start it earlier if you want
                by clicking on one of the hand symbols or pressing the space button. The timer can be stopped with the same inputs as it is started.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> If the space bar is not released before inspection time ends, 
                the current solve will be marked as DNF.

            <p>
                The completed solves appear below the stopwatch under the header <i>Times</i>. 
                You can share your latest solve with the world by clicking on the <em><strong>Share</strong></em>-button. 
                <br>
                <br>
                On the right side from the session times you can view your session statistics: average, median
                and average of last 5 solves. The average of the last 5 solves is counted as a weighted average, 
                where the best and the worst times are removed from calculation.
                <br>
                <br>
                All of the session times can be downloaded as a <i>.txt</i> file by clicking on the <em><strong>Download session times</strong></em>-button.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> The session is ended if the user leaves or refreshes the page. This will cause all session data to be lost.

                The leaderboard is used to store and showcase all of the times shared by our users. 
                Users can share their latest solve by clicking on the <em><strong>Share</strong></em>-button after they have recorded a time.
                The leaderboard stores only the nickname, recorded time, and the scramble set.
